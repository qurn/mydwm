My fork of dwm

My patch 4statusevents applied and synchronized with the icons of myslstatus. 
I find bars easier to percive and they take up less space.
- My statusbar looks like 
⚡▃ @▃ C▁ R▃ ♫▇  29.09.  14:43
- Clicking on the Date will open orage-callender.
- Scrolling over the ♫▇ will change the volume. Clicking will open pavucontrol.
- Scrolling over the C▁ R▃ will change the screens brightness. Clicking will open a terminal.
- The batteryicon will only show if my computer is unplugged.
- Clicking on @▃ will open wpa_gui to connect with wifi-networks.

My patch noNET_SUPPORTING_WM_CHECK applied, so fullscreen videos in firefox fill the tile and not the screen. The colors are solarized.
Patches from suckless.org: attachaside, centeredmaster, noborder and pertag.

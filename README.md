My fork of dwm

-My patch 4statusevents applied and synchronized with the icons of myslstatus. My statusbar looks like 

⚡▃ @▃ C▁ R▃ ♫▇  29.09.  14:43

-Clicking on the Date will open orage-callender.

-Scrolling over the ♫▇ will change the volume. Clicking will open pavucontrol.

-Scrolling over the C▁ R▃ will change the screenbrightness. Clicking will open a terminal.

-The batteryicon will only show if my computer is unplugged.

-Clicking on @▃ will open wpa_gui to connect with wifi-networks.

I find bars easier to percive and they take up less space.

-My patch noNET_SUPPORTING_WM_CHECK applied. 
-Patches from suckless.org: attachaside, centeredmaster, noborder and pertag.
-Colors solarized.
